Kavisle döndü benliğim içinde limitsiz bu şarkı söylenir mirayla doldu suflemiz hamaset. Yandı iştiyakım ikramımda oynar itibarım, yankılarda çaldı sazlarım bazımda canıma cansa kattı lakin. Yok, beyim inatçı kiplerim ve üstelikse devranımda takva. Beraat isterim yürekte, sultanım kepimde alamadımdı diploma ve verse elini pençe atarım erk'e. Yok terazin koy vezin ve mağdur oldu sevkıyatta her bi gönüle vurdu her bi zevkin. Tam isabetin savaş, hedefi netle önüne al kaçırma artık aşkı, şanslarında veriledurdu yek mecal. Kiminde dümeni sal, emaneten bu duygular içinde oyna mutluluk masal. NAKARAT (KORO) Pek bir sivri dilimin ucuna takılan tek çizikli yine her dize yazılan an gelince dizeler uçar ağızdan alarmım \n",

Biraz aram bozuk sizle biliyor musunuz kelimeler? Günden güne şafak tutan kâğıt kalemini bekler. En sonunda yazar kalem kâğıda ve şöyle der; başlangıçtan itibaren bir el beni tetikler. Sözüm şuradan da dışarı insan konuşur haybeden, dilim sanata değmişse yıldızlarım nerde len? V.i.p. koltukta bizim yerimiz yok çocuk, türümüz bizi irdelese de hayallerimiz var çocuk. Koştuğunda varabilirsen değmeden tuzaklara, erişmişsin demektir huzur veren rahatlığa. Bizim sevdamız farklı, derinden ve samimi, bulmalıyım hayatıma yol gösteren kâhini. Kırıktır baktığında geçmiş oysa başarı ileride, gözün görmez hüznü sözün kulak severse. Kim darılsa kim barışsa dengede durmaz, bu nankör hayatın ritmine hiç güven olmaz. Yatıştı hiddetim, refaha erken uyandım sakin. Sorun ne derseniz ki cevaplarını gizlemem. Dürüldü defteri, yolumda yok ki şimdi cahil. Engelse önüme hiçbirini iplemem. Bir maruzatım var üstat, biter bu şarkı bitmeden, geçmez inan içimden acısı ruha rahat vermeden. Hasbelkader resmen, hayatta varlığım, aklen değil de ruhen huzura muhtacım. Hatıralarım ve ben kan davalı bir dostuz, aslen iyi bir arkadaştık, şimdilerde bozgunuz, huzursuzuz. Bugünden istifade edememiş toyuz, yarın yakın fakat bu halde gidemeyiz, umutsuzuz. Uğurlamak gerek, uğursuz misafir ve yolcuları kovmak gerek, bu hâlde olmaz gerçeği görmen gerek. Bak hayat bu dönüyor işte, iyi ve kötünün çevresinde, ziyanı yok toparlan, kendine gelmen gerek. Farkına varmam gereken ne kadar gerçek, yalan varsa gönder, göster, ses ver, zaman dar, bir an evvel. Hatırlat her şeyi, bu gaflet aklı perdeler, mağfiret ister bir zerre, kalbim istirham eder. Hesapsız ve zamansız bir gidişi oldu kalbimin, neyi, nasıl, ne hâlde bulacağımdan emin değildim. Hiçliğe talim, tedavisiz bir hasta bu hâlim, içinden istifade edemedim, tenezzül etmedim. Hayırdır evlat hangi sefere çıktın, hangi limana? Yol ve hava bulutlu bak bir hayli, yelkeni kaldırma. Dur, dümen kır, zaferden hiç seda yok ah bağır çağır, ufukta bir güneş parıldıyor, yiyorsa gel batır! Yatıştı hiddetim, refaha erken uyandım sakin. Sorun ne derseniz ki cevaplarını gizlemem.
